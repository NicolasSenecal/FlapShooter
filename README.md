"# FlapShooter" 
"# 2D arcade game in OpenGL"

The goal of this project was to create a 2D arcade game, halfway between a FLAPPY BIRD and a SPACE SHOOTER using the OpenGL library.
Our realization, named "Flap Shooter", features an angry rabbit flying on a plane in a pixelated horizontal set. With his carrot thrower, he has to fight flying rats while avoiding obstacles and recovering bonuses.

"# Compile and launch the game"

To compile the game, use the makefile file directly in the program folder:
```
make
```
N.B. The SDL 1.2 library must be installed before.

If the game configuration has been changed (file /includes/settings.h), it's recommended to delete all the already compiled files:
```
make clean
```

Finally, to start the game, simply run the command:
```
./bin/FlapShooter
```
